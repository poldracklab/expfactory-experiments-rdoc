> During this task, on each trial you will see a single shape in one of the four quadrants of the screen. Based upon which quadrant the shape is presented, you will complete a different task for that shape.

> In the top two quadrants, please judge the shape based on its color. Press your index finger if it's blue and your middle finger if it's orange.

> In the bottom two quadrants, please judge the shape based on its form. Press your index finger if it's a square and your middle finger if it's a circle.
