# Spatial Task Switching Description
Spatial Task Switching

## Spatial Task Switching trial timing
- test trial
fixation : 500ms 
cue : 150ms
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stimulus presentation, 500ms blank screen)
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
2650ms trial duration 
* 3 blocks
* 65 trials per block (includes 1 extra N/A trial)
/ 1000 
/ 60
= 8.61min
```

- practice trial
fixation : 500ms 
cue : 150ms
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stimulus presentation, 500ms blank screen)
feedback : 500ms
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
3150ms trial duration 
* 1 block
* 5 trials per block (includes 1 extra N/A trial)
/ 1000 
/ 60
= .263min
```

## Spatial Task Switching Conditions and Proportions
task_switch_cue_switch = 50%
task_stay_cue_stay : 25%
task_stay_cue_switch : 25%

3 test blocks
64 test trials for each test block
= 192 test trials total 

3 practice blocks (maxiumum)
16 trials for practice
= 16 practice trials minimum
= 48 practice trials maximum

Accuracy Threshold: .75

Note: practice moves to test if practice block accuracy is > .75 or if current practice block is their third attempt.

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 1

Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.)

During this task, on each trial you will see a single number in one of the four quadrants of the screen. Based upon which quadrant the number appears in, you will complete a different task.

In the top two quadrants, please judge the number based on magnitude (higher or lower than 5). Press your index finger if high, and your middle finger if low.

In the bottom two quadrants, please judge the number based on parity (odd or even). Press your index finger if even, and your middle finger if odd.

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 2
We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on.

Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
