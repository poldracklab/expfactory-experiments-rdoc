## Visual Search trial timing
- test trial
fixation : 500ms
probe : 2000ms (1500ms stimulus presentation, 500ms blank screen)
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
3000ms trial duration 
* 3 blocks
* 64 trials per block 
/ 1000 
/ 60
= 9.6min
```

- practice trial
fixation : 500ms
probe : 2000ms (1500ms stimulus presentation, 500ms blank screen)
feedback : 500ms  
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
3500ms trial duration 
* 1 block
* 4 trials per block 
/ 1000 
/ 60
= .233min

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 1

Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.).

During this task, on each trial rectangles will appear on the screen. The rectangles can be either black or white in color.

<!-- Change instructions to remove "if you determine"? Make it simpler? -->
On some trials, one of these rectangles will be a vertical white rectangle. We will call this rectangle the 'target'.

Your task is to determine whether a target is present or absent on each trial.

If you determine a target is present, press your index finger, and if you determine a target is absent, press your middle finger.

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 2
We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on.

Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
