## CuedTS trial timing
- test trial
fixation : 500ms
cue : 150ms 
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stim presentation, 500ms blank screen)
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
2650ms trial duration 
* 3 blocks 
* 65 trials per block (this includes 1 extra N/A trial per block)
/ 1000 
/ 60
= 8.61min
```

- practice trial
fixation : 500ms
cue : 150ms 
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stim presentation, 500ms blank screen)
practice feedback : 500ms
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
3150ms trial duration 
* 1 block
* 5 trials per block (this includes 1 extra N/A trial per block)
/ 1000 
/ 60
= .263 min per practice block
```

## CuedTS Conditions and Proportions
task_switch_cue_switch = 50%
task_stay_cue_stay : 25%
task_stay_cue_switch : 25%

3 test blocks
64 trials for each test block
= 192 test trials 

3 practice blocks (maximum)
16 trials for practice
= 16 practice trials minimum
= 48 practice trials maxiumum 

Accuracy Threshold: .75

Note: practice moves to test if practice block accuracy is > .75 or if current practice block is their third attempt. 

## CuedTS Instructions

### Enable fullscreen
The experiment will switch to full screen mode when you press the button below

### Welcome Screen
Welcome! This experiment will take around 15 minutes.

Press enter to begin.

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 1
Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.)

During this task you will respond to a sequence of numbers.

Your response will depend on the current task, which can change each trial. On some trials, you will have to indicate whether the number is even or odd, and on other trials you will indicate whether the number is higher or lower than 5. Each trial will start with a cue telling you which task to do on that trial.

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 2
The cue before the number will be a word indicating the task. There will be four different cues indicating two different tasks. The cues and tasks are described below:

Cue "Parity" or "Even-Odd": index finger if even and middle finger if odd.
Cue "Magnitude" or "High-Low": index finger if >5 and middle finger if <5.

We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on.

Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
