# n-Back Description
n-Back

## n-Back trial timing
- test trial
fixation : 500ms
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stim presentation, 500ms blank screen)
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
2500ms trial duration 
* 18 blocks 
* 11 trials per block 
/ 1000 
/ 60
= 8.25min
```

- practice trial
fixation : 500ms
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stim presentation, 500ms blank screen)
practice feedback : 500ms
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
3000ms trial duration 
* 2 blocks (1-back, 2-back)
* 10 trials per block 
/ 1000 
/ 60
= 1min for 1 block of 1-back and 1 block of 2-back
```

## n-Back Conditions and Proportions
(trial-level)
Match : 80% 
Mismatch : 20%

(block-level)
1-back : 50%
2-back : 50%

18 test blocks
11 test trials for each test block
= 198 test trials total 

3 practice blocks (maxiumum)
4 trials for practice
= 10 practice trials minimum
= 30 practice trials maximum

Accuracy Threshold: .75

Note: practice moves to test if practice block accuracy is > .75 or if current practice block is their third attempt. 

## n-Back Instructions

### Enable fullscreen
The experiment will switch to full screen mode when you press the button below

### Welcome Screen
Welcome! This experiment will take around 15 minutes.

To avoid technical issues, please keep the experiment tab (on Chrome or Firefox) active and fullscreen for the whole duration of each task.

Press enter to begin.

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 1
Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.)

During this task, on each trial you will see a letter.

Your task is to match the current letter to the letter that appeared either 1 or 2 trials ago, depending on the delay given to you for that block.

Press your index finger if the letters match, and your middle finger if they mismatch.

Your delay (the number of trials ago to which you compare the current letter) will change from block to block. You will be given the delay at the start of every block of trials.

Capitalization does not matter, so "T" matches with "t". For the first trial in a block with delay 1 and the first two trials in a block with a delay of 2, you can press your middle finger, as there aren't any preceding letters for comparison.

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 2

Your delay for this practice round is 1.

We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on.

Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
