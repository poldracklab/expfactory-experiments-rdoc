### Task Instructions

#### Page 1: Setup

> Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.). During this task, on each trial, you will see a letter.
>
> Your task is to match the current letter to the letter that appeared either 1 or 2 trials ago, depending on the delay given to you for that block.
>
> Press your index finger if the letters match, and your middle finger if they mismatch.
>
> Your delay (the number of trials ago to which you compare the current letter) will change from block to block. You will be given the delay at the start of every block of trials.
>
> Capitalization does not matter, so "T" matches with "t". For the first trial in a block with delay 1 and the first two trials in a block with a delay of 2, you can press your middle finger, as there aren't any preceding letters for comparison.

#### Page 2: Practice Round Instructions

> Your delay for this practice round is 1.
>
> We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on.
>
> Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
