## Stroop trial timing
- test trial
fixation : 500ms
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stimulus presentation, 500ms blank screen)
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
2500ms trial duration 
* 3 blocks
* 40 trials per block 
/ 1000 
/ 60
= 5min
```

- practice trial
fixation : 500ms
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stimulus presentation, 500ms blank screen)
feedback : 500ms  
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 1

<!-- Do I need to simplify these instructions at all? Seem kind of long. -->
Place your index finger on the comma key (,), your middle finger on the period key (.), and your ring finger on the slash key (/).

During this task, on each trial you will be presented with a single word on the screen. The word will always be one of these three: 'RED', 'BLUE', or 'GREEN'.

Each word will appear in a certain color. Note the color of the word may not match the word itself. For example, you might see the word 'RED' colored in green, like this: RED.

Your task is to identify the color in which the word is displayed, not the word itself. So, if you see the word 'RED' displayed in green, you should press the key corresponding to green.

Press your index finger if the color is red.

Press your middle finger if the color is blue.

Press your ring finger if the color is green.
