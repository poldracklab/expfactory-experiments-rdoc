### Task Instructions

#### Page 1: Setup

> Place your fingers on the arrow keys.

> During this task, you will first encounter an 8x8 grid filled with black and gray cells. You have to determine if the grid is symmetric or not. Press the left arrow key if the grid is asymmetric and press the right arrow key if it is symmetric.

> When you make a response, a new 8x8 grid will immediately appear, and you should complete as many correct symmetry judgments as you can. Then a single 4x4 grid will appear. This grid will have one cell colored black. Try to remember the location of the black cell.

> This sequence of 8x8 grids and 4x4 grid will alternate four times. After the fourth time, a blank 4x4 grid will be presented.

> On the blank 4x4 grid, use the arrow keys to navigate the grid and the spacebar to select the cells you think were colored black in the preceding 4 4x4 grids. Please select them in the order they were shown (i.e., respond with the location of the first black square in the 4x4 grid, then the 2nd, â€¦).

#### Page 2: Practice Round Instructions

> During the practice round, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be removed for the actual test, so make sure that you understand the instructions before moving on.

> Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
