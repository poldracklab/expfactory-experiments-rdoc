### Task Instructions

#### Page 1: Setup

> Place your fingers on the arrow keys.

> During this task, you will see a fixation (\*\*\*\*) followed by a 4x4 grid. This 4x4 grid will have one cell colored black. Try to remember the location of the black cell.

> This sequence of a fixation (\*\*\*\*) and 4x4 grid will alternate four times. After the fourth time, a blank 4x4 grid will be presented.

> On the blank 4x4 grid, use the arrow keys to navigate the grid and the spacebar to select the cells you think were colored black in the preceding 4 4x4 grids. Please select them in the order they were shown (i.e., respond with the location of the first black square in the 4x4 grid, then the 2nd, â€¦).

#### Page 2: Practice Round Instructions

> During the practice round, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be removed for the actual test, so make sure that you understand the instructions before moving on.
