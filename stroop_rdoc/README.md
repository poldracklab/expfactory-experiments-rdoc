### Task Instructions

#### Page 1: Setup

> Place your index finger on the comma key (,), your middle finger on the period key (.), and your ring finger on the forward slash key (/)

> During this task, on each trial you will be presented with a single word on the screen. This word will be 'RED', 'BLUE', or 'GREEN'.

> Each word will appear in colored ink. The color of the word may not match the word itself. For example, you might see the word 'RED' in green ink, like this: RED.

> Your task is to identify the color of the ink in which the word is displayed, not the word itself. So, if you see the word 'RED' in green ink, you should press the key corresponding to green.

> Press your index finger if the color is blue.

> Press your middle finger if the color is red.

> Press your ring finger if the color is green.
