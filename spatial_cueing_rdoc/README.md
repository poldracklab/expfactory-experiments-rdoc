# Spatial Cueing Description
Spatial Cueing


## Spatial Cueing trial timing
- test trial
fixation : 500ms
cue : Math.floor(Math.random() * 1200) + 400;
fixation : 500ms
probe : 1000ms
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

- practice trial
fixation : 500ms
cue : Math.floor(Math.random() * 1200) + 400;
fixation : 500ms
probe : 1000ms
feedback : 500ms
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

## Spatial Cueing Conditions and Proportions
No Cue : 33.33% (8/24)
Double Cue : 33.33% (8/24)
Valid Cue : 25% (6/24)
Invalid Cue : 8.33% (2/24)

3 test blocks
72 test trials for each test block
= 216 test trials total 

3 practice blocks (maxiumum)
12 trials for practice
= 12 practice trials minimum
= 36 practice trials maximum

Accuracy Threshold: .75

Note: practice moves to test if practice block accuracy is > .75 or if current practice block is their third attempt.

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 1

Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.)

<!-- consider rewording -->
During this task, on each trial you will see two boxes on the screen, and then a star appear in either the left or right box.

Your task is to press your index finger if the star appears in the left box, and your middle finger if the star appears in the right box.

On some trials, one or both of the boxes will be highlighted before the star appears. 

<!-- Include this? : No matter which box(es) are highlighted, it is important that you quickly and accurately indicate where the star appears. -->

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 2
We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on.

Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
