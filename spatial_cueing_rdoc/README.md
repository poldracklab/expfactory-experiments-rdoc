### Task Instructions

#### Page 1: Setup

> Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.). During this task, on each trial, you will see two boxes on the screen, and then a star appear in either the left or right box.
>
> Your task is to press your index finger if the star appears in the left box, and your middle finger if the star appears in the right box.
>
> On some trials, one or both of the boxes will be highlighted before the star appears. This is to cue your attention. Pay attention to these cues as they might indicate where the star will appear.

#### Page 2: Practice Round

> We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on.
>
