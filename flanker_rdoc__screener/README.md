## Flanker trial timing
- test trial
fixation : 500ms
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stim presentation, 500ms blank screen)
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
2500ms trial duration 
* 3 blocks 
* 40 trials per block 
/ 1000 
/ 60
= 5min
```

- practice trial
fixation : 500ms
probe : 1500ms (1000ms stim presentation, 500ms blank screen)
practice feedback : 500ms
ITI : 500ms (mean), 0ms (min), 5000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
3000ms trial duration 
* 1 block
* 4 trials per block 
/ 1000 
/ 60
= .2 min
```

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 1
Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.)

During this task, on each trial you will see a string of F's and H's. For instance, you might see 'FFFFF' or 'HHFHH'.

If the middle letter is an H, press your index finger.
If the middle letter is an F, press your middle finger.
So, if you see 'FFHFF', you would press your index finger.

We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on.

Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
