### Task Instructions

#### Page 1: Setup

> Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.).
>
> During this task, on each trial, you will see shapes appear on the screen one at a time.
>
> If the shape is a circle, press your index finger.
>
> If the shape is a square, press your middle finger.
>
> You should respond as quickly and accurately as possible to each shape.

#### Page 2: Setup cont.

> On some trials, a star will appear around the shape, shortly after the shape appears.
>
> If you see the star, please try your best to withhold your response on that trial.
>
> If the star appears and you try your best to withhold your response, you will find that you will be able to stop sometimes, but not always.
>
> Please do not slow down your responses in order to wait for the star. It is equally important to respond quickly on trials without the star as it is to stop on trials with the star.

#### Page 3: Practice Round

> We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on.
>
> Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
