#### Task-Specific Instructions

##### Page 1: Setup

> Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.). During this task, you will respond to a sequence of numbers. Your response will depend on the current task, which can change each trial. On some trials, you will have to indicate whether the number is even or odd, and on other trials you will indicate whether the number is higher or lower than 5. Each trial will start with a cue telling you which task to do on that trial.

##### Page 2: Rules

> The cue before the number will be a word indicating the task. There will be four different cues indicating two different tasks. The cues and tasks are described below:
>
> - Cue "Parity" or "Even-Odd": Index finger if even, and middle finger if odd.
> - Cue "Magnitude" or "High-Low": Index finger if >5, and middle finger if <5.
>   We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on. Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
